How To Play:

(TODO: describe the controls and (if needed) goals/strategy.)
- Meteors leave a trail of flames when they crash, and these flame paths can intersect. You may want to slow down to traverse the environment more safely... or speed on through with quick jumps to preserve your combo meter!
- Have you tried Boost Hopping (or as I like to call it, "bopping")? Once your Boost ends, you'll gradually decelerate to your standard top speed on the ground. But in Rubbapocalypse, you maintain most of your lateral momentum while airborne, so if you keep jumping with good timing, you can preserve the momentum of the Boost even after it ends... but only in one direction. Use it wisely to gain points and reach Medals faster, but watch where you're going!

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
